Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Humidity Intelligence**.

This guide covers **UI and dashboard contributions only**.

UI contributions explore **how that intelligence is presented**.

There is no preferred style.

## 🧠 Design intent

UIs should atleast help answer:

* Where is the risk?
* How serious is it?
* What should I do now?

If your UI helps someone understand their building better, it belongs here.

If your UI uses or is inspired by others:

* Credit authors
* Link where appropriate
